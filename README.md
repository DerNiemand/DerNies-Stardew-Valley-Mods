# The Project 
This is a collection of mods adding different arcade style Minigames to Stardew Valley. They are intended to be used as part of a Mod being made by SuzukiPC.
While all Minigames work standalone, they don't have any Place in the World where they can be played by interacting, and are only available through console commands.

# The Minigames
## StackAttack
A Minigame about Stacking rows of Blocks on Top of each other to reach high enough for a reward. Ater getting enough rows for a small reward, the player can choose to cashout
or go for a large reward but giving up the small reward and risking to not get any reward when failing.  
Status: Most Features are complete, the last thing planned as of now is an animation for over hanging drops falling down and breaking.
